-sC: Enables the default script scan. Uses a set of standard Nmap scripts to gather additional information about the target.

-F: Scans fewer ports (fast mode), focusing only on those most commonly used.

-sS: Performs a stealth SYN scan, which is less likely to be detected by firewalls.

-O --osscan-guess: Attempts to determine the operating system of the target and guesses if uncertain.

-sV --version-intensity 8: Detects service versions with a high intensity level (8), which can provide more detailed results.

-A: Enables aggressive mode, combining OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

-Sn: Disables port scanning and only performs host discovery (ping scan).

ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep -e "sql"
Lists all Nmap scripts related to SQL vulnerabilities or services in the scripts directory.

-sS -sV --script=ftp-anon,memcached-info -p55413 
Performs a stealth SYN scan and version detection on port 55413, using specific scripts (ftp-anon, memcached-info) 

-sS -sV --script=ftp-* -p55413 -T4: Similar to the above, but uses all scripts matching the ftp-* pattern.

-f --mtu --data-length: Enables fragmentation to evade firewalls, adjusts MTU size, and specifies the length of data payloads.

-D: Enables decoy scanning, disguising the user's IP with multiple decoys.

-sA: Performs an ACK scan, useful for determining firewall rules.

-g 53: Sets the source port to 53, which can sometimes bypass firewalls by mimicking DNS traffic.

--host-timeout 5s;5m;2h

--scan-delay 5s
