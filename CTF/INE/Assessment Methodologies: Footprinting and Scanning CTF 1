Tasks: 

    Flag 1: The server proudly announces its identity in every response. Look closely; you might find something unusual.
    Flag 2: The gatekeeper's instructions often reveal what should remain unseen. Don't forget to read between the lines.
    Flag 3: Anonymous access sometimes leads to forgotten treasures. Connect and explore the directory; you might stumble upon something valuable.
    Flag 4: A well-named database can be quite revealing. Peek at the configurations to discover the hidden treasure.
